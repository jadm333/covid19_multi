# Introduction

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic was declared a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern on January 30, 2020 by the World Health
Organization.The Mexican Health Authorithies declared the first lockdown
on March 26 with 585 cases and 8 deaths reported for COVID-19 @Carrillo-Vega2020;
by the end of the lockdown (June 5th, 2020) total number of cases and deaths were 110,026 and 13,170, respectively. By November 1, Mexico became the fourth country in
number of deaths of SARS-CoV-19 (106,765 deaths), with 1,122,362 incident
cases @OrganizacionPanamericanadelaSalud2021; by April 15th  2021 the number of deaths had raised to 214,372 with 2,309,099 incident cases. 

Over time it has become clear that comorbidy factors such as
hypertension, diabetes, obesity and smoking increase
the seriousness of the disease, leading to a higher rate of hospitalizations with an additional 25\% of the
cases requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and ultimately, intubation @SEDESA2021. Mexico ranks second in obesity among OECD countries, with an obesity rate of 72.5\%  among the adult population, which is associated
with the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, estimated at 13\% of the
adult population in 2017, the highest rate among OECD
countries; the rate of hypertension is also one of the highest chronic diseases among
adult population with 30\% @OCDE2019. The high prevalence of these comorbidities
besides the precarious health care system could be among the main 
main reasons of the elevated severity of the number of cases and deaths rates in the country. 


In Mexico the health institutions are divided in public and private services. There are different public institutions which provide care to different sets of the population: the state employees, the army and naval members, the oil state company (PEMEX) employees and private companies employees. There are also public hospitals for population with no health service coverage. In general, the care withing different healthcare providers cannot be considered homogeneous, therefore it should be relevant for the final outcome of a COVID-19  patient.  

There have been  efforts to understand how patients with
comorbilities are affected by  COVID-19; the work by  @Bello-Chavolla2020 proposed a clinical score to
predict COVID-19 lethality, including different factors like
diabetes and obesity among mexican population. This work lead to believe that
obesity mediates 49.5\% of the effect of diabetes on COVID-19 lethality.
Early-onset diabetes conferred an increased risk of hospitalization while
obesity increased the risk ICU for admission
and intubation.


After onset of infection there is a period of time between symptom
detection and hospitalization. The time elapsed before patients approach
hospitals could be excessively long. Once patients are admitted to
hospital, there is also a period of time between the admission and
death. Estimation of these lengths of time through a multilevel model
could enable a better information system to estimate incidence and
transmission rates, particularly at regional level where differences
can be apparent. 

This work considers a multi-state model under a Bayesian framework to
estimate times between symptom detection and hospitalization and between
hospitalization and death. Data used in the modeling comes from the
official database by the Mexican Ministry of Health; the analysis
provides of general overview of hospitalizations in each state of the
country and the different health institutions within. Variables
affecting the patient's final outcome such as the aforementioned
comorbidites are included in the model. Additionally regional
heterogeneity is accounted for trough nested models that consider the
regional contribution and also the health service provider. Other
efforts in recent literature @Kirwan have considered more states
(hospitalization-ICU, ICU-death, ICU-discharged), which allows researchers to asses whether improvements in patient outcomes have been sustained, finding evidence that median hospital stays have lengthened.
Unfortunately the data available for Mexico lacks the necessary granularity to determine such states. Nevertheless, we believe this model
could better inform the estimation of the  incidence and
transmission rates, which is  particularly important while new variants and
increased transmission rates are present.


# Methods and materials

## Data Source and Study Population
 We conducted a prevalence study of the official database from the Mexican
Ministry of Health, these data provide an overview of hospital
admissions, deaths and the period of time between hospitalizations and
first COVID-19 symptoms between March and December 2020. The data analyzed
included mexican adult population diagnosed with COVID-19 in the whole
country. Exclusion criteria were the observations with incomplete
data about hospital admission, symptoms or comorbidities. Additionally,
patients whose time of initial symptoms was captured as the day they were
admitted to hospital were removed, since this time was likely to be
unknown. After applying exclusion criteria a total sample of 1200
registers of adult patients belonging to any healthcare provider,
either private or public in the 32 states of Mexico was selected,
preserving the population characteristics. \textcolor{red}{JUAN PABLO ESTE NUMERO DE
MUESTRA ES CORRECTO?}

Comorbidities that could worsen the patient outcome, affecting the times
we aim to model; such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, immunosuppression and
chronic kidney disease were included as linear predictors for each state
in the model and so two different relevant groups of variables were statistically
significant for each state:
  
  $$x_{death} = (\sim Diabetes+COPD+Obesity+Hypertension+Diabetes*Obesity*Hypertension+Kidney\_Disease)$$

$$
  x_{hospitalization} = (\sim COPD+Obesity + Kidney\_Disease+Asthma+Immunosuppression)$$

 \textcolor{red}{NO SE SI SEA CLARO LO ANTERIOR PUESTO DE ESTA MANERA (HAY QUE ARREGLAR LA EXPRESION); O SI MEJOR SE DESCRIBA CON PALABRAS}

About 87\% of the population in Mexico is affiliated to some healthcare
provider, but during this pandemic the mexican government has established
a list of hospitals designated to treat COVID-19 patients without any
affiliation distinction. In this study we identified 6 different
healthcare providers which were classified according to their sectors IMSS, ISSSTE,
SEDENA/SEMAR/PEMEX, SSA, ESTATALES (healthcare provider within each
state) these 5 are public care providers while the sixth sector is
private hospitals. It is worth mentioning that following the national
hospital transformation plan @Mendoza-Popoca2020, IMSS alone has transformed about
260 medical units to treat COVID-19 patients @UNAM2021.

## Modelling
We developed four different Bayesian models for trajectories of interest
namely, \emph{Symptoms-Hospitalization} and
\emph{Hospitalization-Death}, in which non-informative initial
distributions were used, located near \(0\), to improve convergence.


\textbf{Figure 1}. Graphical representation of the model: directed acyclic grph (DAG).

Additionally a \textit{QR} reparameterization for the covariate matrix
was used, that is, if \(X\) is an \(n \times m\) covariate matrix,
corresponding to the aforementioned comorbidities, \(X=QR\), where \(Q\)
is an ortogonal matrix and \(R\) is an upper triangular matrix. In
practice, considering \(X=Q'R'\) where \(Q'=Q\sqrt{n-1}\) and
\(R'=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n-1}}R\) is convenient. Hence if \(\zeta\) is the
\textit{N} linear predictor vector such that \(\zeta=X\beta\), with
\(\beta\) an \textit{M} coefficient vector, then
\(\zeta=X\beta=QR\beta=Q'R'\beta\). We used \(\zeta=Q'R'\beta\) for
numerical stability.


Each model captures different levels of information, as more levels were included it
was possible to differentiate the results according to the added information. The four levels  were:

### Model I: One level

Vectors $M$ and $H$ correspond to  survival times 
for deaths and hospitalizations, respectively. We considered a different
set of covariables in each case and assumed deaths and
hospitalizations are independent, we then define the model as
 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 {M}  &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\eta})\\
 {H}  &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\upsilon}) \\
 \mathbf{\eta} &= \exp\left(-\frac{\mu_m+\mathbf{Q}^*\mathbf{\vartheta}}{\alpha}\right) \\
 \mathbf{\upsilon} &= \exp\left(-\frac{\mu_h+\mathbf{Q}^{**}\mathbf{\theta}}{\alpha}\right) \\
 \alpha&=\exp(\alpha_r*\tau_\alpha) \\
 \alpha_r&\sim N(0,1) \\
 \mu_m,\mu_h &\sim N(0,\tau_\mu) \\
 \mathbf{\vartheta},\mathbf{\theta} &\sim U(-\infty,\infty) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

where $Q^*$ and $Q^{**}$ are matrices of standarized covariables for deaths and hospitalizations respectively  and $\tau_\alpha$ and  $\tau_{\mu}$ are given positive values \textcolor{red}{QUIZA AQUI PONER LOS VALORES}. This model is described in grey in Figure REF.

### Model II: two levels


The second model is based on the first one, an additional level is added
to account for each state of Mexico to model deaths. The hospitalization  $H$  remains  unchanged and for each state  $l= 1,\ldots, 32$, deaths are summarized in matrix  $M_{l}$ the model is defined as 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 M_l   &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\eta})\\
 H  &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\upsilon}) \\
 \mathbf{\eta} &= \exp\left(-\frac{\mu_m+\mathbf{\mu}_l^r+\mathbf{Q}^*\mathbf{\vartheta}}{\alpha}\right),\space\space l=1,...,32\\
 \mathbf{\upsilon} &= \exp(-\frac{\mu_h+\mathbf{Q}^{**}\mathbf{\theta}}{\alpha}) \\
 \mathbf{\mu}_l&=\sigma*\mathbf{\mu}_l^r \\
 \alpha&=\exp(\alpha^r*\tau_\alpha) \\
 \alpha^r&\sim N(0,1) \\
 \mu^r_l&\sim N(0,1) \\
 \sigma&\sim t^+_3(0,1) \\
 \mu_m,\mu_h &\sim N(0,\tau_\mu) \\
 \mathbf{\vartheta},\mathbf{\theta} &\sim U(-\infty,\infty) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
where $Q^*$ and $Q^{**}$ are matrices of standarized covariables for deaths and hospitalizations respectively  and $\tau_\alpha$ and  $\tau_{\mu}$ are given positive values. This model is described in green in Figure REF.

#### Model III: Three levels

Based on Model II, we consider a third level to include the healthcare provider where patients are hospitalized,  $k$,  in state $l$ we have $M_{l,k}$for the corresponding death matrix and the model is given as



$$
\begin{aligned}
 M_{l,k}   &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\eta})\\
 H  &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\upsilon}) \\
 \mathbf{\eta} &= \exp \left(-\frac{\mu_m+\mathbf{\mu}_l^r+\mathbf{\mu}_k^r+\mathbf{Q}^*\mathbf{\vartheta}}{\alpha} \right),\space\space l=1,...,32,\space k=1,...,5\\
 \mathbf{\upsilon} &= \exp\left(-\frac{\mu_h+\mathbf{Q}^{**}\mathbf{\theta}}{\alpha}\right) \\
  \mathbf{\mu}_l&=\sigma_l*\mathbf{\mu}_l^r, \space\space l=1,2 \\
 \mathbf{\mu}_k&=\sigma_l*\mathbf{\mu}_k^r \\
 \alpha&=\exp(\alpha^r*\tau_\alpha) \\
 \alpha^r&\sim N(0,1) \\
 \mu^r_l,\mu^r_k &\sim N(0,1) \\
 \sigma_l&\sim t^+_3(0,1) \\
 \mu_m,\mu_h &\sim N(0,\tau_\mu) \\
 \mathbf{\vartheta},\mathbf{\theta} &\sim U(-\infty,\infty) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
where $Q^*$ and $Q^{**}$ are matrices of standarized covariables for deaths and hospitalizations respectively  and $\tau_\alpha$ and  $\tau_{\mu}$ are given positive values. This model is described in yellow in Figure REF.

### Model IV:

Based as well on  Modelo II, we consider index $j=(l,k)$ where $l$ accounts for the $l$-th state  and $k$ for the healthcare provider, $j \in \{1,...,153\}$ where the distribution for deaths is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
 M_j &\sim Weibull\left(\alpha, \mathbf{\eta} \right) \\
 H  &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\upsilon}) \\
 \mathbf{\eta} &= \exp \left(-\frac{\mu_m+\mathbf{\mu}_j^r+\mathbf{Q}^*\mathbf{\vartheta}}{\alpha} \right),\space\\
 \mathbf{\upsilon} &= \exp\left(-\frac{\mu_h+\mathbf{Q}^{**}\mathbf{\theta}}{\alpha}\right) \\
 \mathbf{\mu}_j&=\sigma_j*\mathbf{\mu}_j^r \\
 \alpha&=\exp(\alpha^r*\tau_\alpha) \\
 \alpha^r&\sim N(0,1) \\
 \mu^r_l,\mu^r_k &\sim N(0,1) \\
 \sigma_j&\sim t^+_3(0,1) \\
 \mu_j &\sim N(0,\tau_\mu) \\
 \mathbf{\vartheta},\mathbf{\theta} &\sim U(-\infty,\infty) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

where \(Q^*\) and \(Q^{**}\) are matrices of standarized covariables
for deaths and hospitalizations respectively and \(\tau_\alpha\) and
\(\tau_{\mu}\) are given positive values. 

\textcolor{red}{JUAN PABLO, EL ULTIMO MODELO HAY QUE CHECARLO PARA VER QUE SEA CORRECTO.}


To choose the model that best fits the data we considered
the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) proposed by @Vehtari2017, which
estimates pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy, using the
log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter
values, Table 1.

Model II          &   -75352.2 (186.3) &  84.1 (4.7)\\
Model III         &    -75284.9 (186.6) &  92.5 (4.9)  \\

# Results
The parameters were estimated using Stan \textcolor{red}{DAR QUIZA M√ÅS DETALLES}. We show
results for model III which performed better in terms of the
likelihood and showed good convergence of all parameteres. The posterior
0.95 credibility intervals for parameters of interest at different
levels of the model are shown in Figures 2 and 3. It is worth pointing
out that we are displaying the log hazard ratio, hence positive values
for parameters will point to increasing risks for the corresponding
transition and level.


\textbf{Figure 2}. Hazard rate in logarithmic scale by state, credible interval of 95\%.




\textbf{Figure 3}. Hazard rate in logarithmic scale by health institution, credible interval of 95\%.
  

Increased risk for hospitalization was observed at the global population
level for chronic renal disease, whereas for death such was the case for
COPD and the interaction of diabetes:hypertension:obesity.


\textbf{Figure 4}. Predictive distribution for deaths.


Our results show that there are differences in mortality between the
states without accounting for institution and it is
related to the prompt time of death or viceversa. Figure 2
shows the states in which the overall rate of mortality is higher such
as Campeche, Colima, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Morelos, Nayarit,
Oaxaca, Puebla, Tabasco and Veracruz. The difference might be linked to
the late hospitalization of patients.


Figure 4 displays evidence that 5 days after hospitalization
there is a peak on mortality rate, which could be related due the late
hospitalization of patients with mild symptoms who developed ``happy
hypoxemia,'' that is extremely low blood oxygenation, but without
sensation of dyspnea  @Gonzalez-Duarte2020. In Wuhan, within a cohort of patients infected with (SARS-COV-2) who id not present dyspnea 62\% showed
severe disease and 46\%  ended up intubated, ventilated or dead @Guan2020.



Regarding the 6 healthcare providers  included in the analysis
differences were also found. While state-managed hospitals and private
sector showed lower risks, in contrast the IMSS seems to be the one with
the highest risk (Figure 3). Although it is worth mentioning that
following the national hospital transformation plan @Mendoza-Popoca2020, IMSS alone
has transformed about 260 medical units to treat Covid-19 patients
 @UNAM2021. Additionaly it has the largest number of affiliations and they are  liklely to have higher risk exposure. 


# Disscusion
Multiple sources have shownthat the presence of comorbidities such
as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), asthma, inmmuno-suppression and chronic kidney disease
are associated to a worse outcome for the patients diagnosed with
COVID-19. Particularly for those who are hospitalized in the ICU due
intubation. To our knowledge this is the first study in Mexico which
analyzed the time elapsed between the patient¬¥s first symptoms,
hospitalization and death; these analyses were further broken down to the
different states of the republic and the healthcare providers within
them. Thus it is possible to identify providers and states with an increased
risk of hospitalization and death. Mexico is the
third place in obesity among the OCDE countries, which could be the main reason of the high number of severe cases of COVID-19. \textcolor{red}{JUAN PABLO, AQUI SE PUEDEN AGREGAR REFERENCIAS.}

 
One problem that aggravates the situation is the precarious state of the public
healthcare system which universal coverage is estimated about 87\% of
the mexican population. It is clear that mexican healthcare has overrun
during this pandemic and has appealed to private health providers to
cope with the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Among all health care
providers the IMSS is the one with the highest risk, however
it is the largest healthcare provider across Mexico with hospitals from
level 2-level 4 of which "Siglo XXI" is a country-leader in
research and innovative treatments and procedures. In March, 2020 38  hospitals were "converted"  @Mendoza-Popoca2020 to exclusively treat
COVID-19  among which 18 were IMSS hospitals
only; after one year 960 hospitals across the country were converted to
treat patients with COVID-19 of these 289 (30.10\%) belong to IMSS
@UNAM2021. 

The proposed modelling can be helpful to a regional level to improve healthcare
assistance, it could additionally be useful to inform statistical
estimation of parameters for an epidemiological model.

This study has shown that there are differences in mortality between the
different states of the republic; there are states in which the overall
rate of mortality is higher due the late hospitalization of patients
such as Veracruz, Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potos√≠, Guanajuato, Chiapas and
Mexico City. Breaking down this analysis to state level we found a
higher risk of hospitalization, specifically in Veracruz  which
 has been historically unsteady regarding the public healthcare system in
sectors like IMSS, ISSSTE, SEDENA/SEMAR/PEMEX. The fact that different final outcomes could be related to patient's
late hospitalization, hence suggesting that the average patient waits
until the symptoms are severe to seek professional healthcare, needs to
be further investigated.

One of the  limitations of the study is the reduced number of states
we were able to include in the modls due to the lack of information
regarding dates of disccharged of recovered patient¬¥s after hospitalization.
