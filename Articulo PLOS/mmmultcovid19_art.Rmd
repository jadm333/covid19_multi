## Introduction

  The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 by the World Health Organization.The Mexican Health Authorithies declared the first lockdown on March 26 with 585 cases and 8 deaths reported for COVID-19 (2); at the end of the first lockdown (june 5th 2020) the total cases were 110,026 and 13 170 deaths. Until November 1, Mexico is the fourth country in death rates of SARS-CoV-19 (106,765 deaths), with 1,122,362 incident cases (3).

  Over time it has become clear that the presence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and smoking are factors that increase the serious illness that leads to hospitalization and in 25% of the cases they required admission and intubation to the intensive care unit (4). Mexico ranks second in obesity among OECD countries, with almost 72.5% obesity among the adult population, which is associated with the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, estimated at 13% of the adult population in 2017, which is the highest rate among OECD countries (5); hypertension is also one of the higher chronic diseases among adult population 30% (6). The high prevalence of these comorbidities together with the lack of a functional health care system is believed to be the main reason why the severe cases and deaths rates in the country are so high.

After onset of infection there is a period of time between symptom detection and hospitalization. The time elapsed before patients approach hospitals could  be excessively long. Once patients are admmited to hospital, there is also a period of time between the admission and death. Modeling these times through a multilevel survival model could enable a better information system to estimate the probabilities for the transitions of interest an in turn the incidence and transmission rates, particularly at regional level since differences have already been established. 


Data used in the modeling comes from the official database by the Mexican Ministry of Health; the analysis provides of general overview of hospitalizations in each state of the country and the different health institutions within. This work considers a multi-state model to describe hospital resource usage enabling an evaluation of disease severity. 

  This study shows how different the outcomes can be for the patient due the late hospitalization, this lead to believe that the average patients waits until the symptoms are severe to seek professional healthcare.

## Methods and materials

### Data Source and Study Population

  We conducted a prevalence study the official database from the Mexican Ministry of Health, this data provides a overview of hospital admissions, deaths and the period of time between hospitalizations and first symptoms between March and December 2020. The data analyzed included mexican adult population diagnosed with COVID-19 in the whole country; the exclusion criteria were the observations with incomplete data about hospital admission, symptoms or comorbidities. Additionally patiends whose time of intial symptoms was captured as the day the were admited to hospital were removed, since this time was likely to be unknown. After applying exclusion criteria a total sample of 1200 registers of adult patients belonging to any healthcare institution, either private or public in the 32 states of Mexico was selected, preserving the population characteristics. JUAN PABLO ESTE NUMERO DE MUESTRA ES CORRECTO?

  Comorbidities that could worsen the patient outcome such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, autoimmune diseases and chronic kidney disease were considered as well as the interactions between two or more of these.

  About 87% of population in Mexico belong to some healthcare institution but during this pandemic mexican government has established a list of hospitals designated to treat COVID-19 patients without any affiliation distinction. In this study we identified 5 different healthcare providers which were classified as sectors IMSS, ISSSTE, SEDENA/SEMAR/PEMEX, SSA these 4 are the public care provider and the fifth sector is private hospitals.


### Modelling

The primary outcome was the time between symptoms and hospitalization and from hospitalization to death. The models enable us to look at these results for each state of the mexican Republic and the healthcare institutions within them.

We developed four different Bayesian models  for trajectories of interest namely,  *Symptoms-Hospitalization* and *Hospitalization-Death*, in which non-informative initial distributions were used, located near $0$, to improve convergence. Additionally a \textit{QR} reparameterization for the covariable matrix was used, that is, if  $X$ is an  $n \times m$ covariable matrix, corresponding to the aforementioned comorbidities, $X=QR$, where $Q$ is an ortogonal  matrix and  $R$ is an upper triangular matrix. In practice,  considering $X=Q'R'$ where $Q'=Q\sqrt{n-1}$ and $R'=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n-1}}R$ is convinient. Hence if  $\zeta$ is the  \textit{N} linear predictor  vector such that $\zeta=X\beta$, with $\beta$ a \textit{K}  coefficient vector, then  $\zeta=X\beta=QR\beta=Q'R'\beta$. We used  $\zeta=Q'R'\beta$  for numerical stability.

#### Model I: One level

Patient $i$ corresponds to the $i$-th row of vectors $M$ and $H$ for deaths and hospitalizations, respectively. We assumed deaths  and hospitalizations are independent and the model is given as  

$$
\begin{aligned}
 {M}  &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\eta})\\
 {H}  &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\upsilon}) \\
 \mathbf{\eta} &= \exp\left(-\frac{\mu_m+\mathbf{Q}^*\mathbf{\vartheta}}{\alpha}\right) \\
 \mathbf{\upsilon} &= \exp\left(-\frac{\mu_h+\mathbf{Q}^{**}\mathbf{\theta}}{\alpha}\right) \\
 \alpha&=\exp(\alpha_r*\tau_\alpha) \\
 \alpha_r&\sim N(0,1) \\
 \mu_m,\mu_h &\sim N(0,\tau_\mu) \\
 \mathbf{\vartheta},\mathbf{\theta} &\sim U(-\infty,\infty) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

where $Q^*$ and $Q^{**}$ are matrices of standarized covariables for deaths and hospitalizations respectively  and $\tau_\alpha$ and  $\tau_{\mu}$ are given positive values. 

#### Model II: two levels

The second model is based on the first one, an additional level is added to account for each state of Mexico to model deaths. The hospitalization  $H$  remains  unchanged and for each state  $l= 1,\ldots, 32$ and  patient $i$, deaths are summarized in matriz  $M_{l}$ the model is defined as 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 M_l   &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\eta})\\
 H  &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\upsilon}) \\
 \mathbf{\eta} &= \exp\left(-\frac{\mu_m+\mathbf{\mu}_l^r+\mathbf{Q}^*\mathbf{\vartheta}}{\alpha}\right),\space\space l=1,...,32\\
 \mathbf{\upsilon} &= \exp(-\frac{\mu_h+\mathbf{Q}^{**}\mathbf{\theta}}{\alpha}) \\
 \mathbf{\mu}_l&=\sigma*\mathbf{\mu}_l^r \\
 \alpha&=\exp(\alpha^r*\tau_\alpha) \\
 \alpha^r&\sim N(0,1) \\
 \mu^r_l&\sim N(0,1) \\
 \sigma&\sim t^+_3(0,1) \\
 \mu_m,\mu_h &\sim N(0,\tau_\mu) \\
 \mathbf{\vartheta},\mathbf{\theta} &\sim U(-\infty,\infty) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
where $Q^*$ and $Q^{**}$ are matrices of standarized covariables for deaths and hospitalizations respectively  and $\tau_\alpha$ and  $\tau_{\mu}$ are given positive values. 

#### Model III: Three levels

Based on  Model II, we consider a third level to include the type of health service where patients are hospitalized, $k$, for patient $i$ in state $l$ we have $M_{l,k}$ for the corresponding death matrix and the model is given as 



$$
\begin{aligned}
 M_{l,k}   &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\eta})\\
 H  &\sim Weibull(\alpha,\mathbf{\upsilon}) \\
 \mathbf{\eta} &= \exp \left(-\frac{\mu_m+\mathbf{\mu}_l^r+\mathbf{\mu}_k^r+\mathbf{Q}^*\mathbf{\vartheta}}{\alpha} \right),\space\space l=1,...,32,\space k=1,...,5\\
 \mathbf{\upsilon} &= \exp\left(-\frac{\mu_h+\mathbf{Q}^{**}\mathbf{\theta}}{\alpha}\right) \\
  \mathbf{\mu}_l&=\sigma_l*\mathbf{\mu}_l^r, \space\space l=1,2 \\
 \mathbf{\mu}_k&=\sigma_l*\mathbf{\mu}_k^r \\
 \alpha&=\exp(\alpha^r*\tau_\alpha) \\
 \alpha^r&\sim N(0,1) \\
 \mu^r_l,\mu^r_k &\sim N(0,1) \\
 \sigma_l&\sim t^+_3(0,1) \\
 \mu_m,\mu_h &\sim N(0,\tau_\mu) \\
 \mathbf{\vartheta},\mathbf{\theta} &\sim U(-\infty,\infty) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
where $Q^*$ and $Q^{**}$ are matrices of standarized covariables for deaths and hospitalizations respectively  and $\tau_\alpha$ and  $\tau_{\mu}$ are given positive values. 

#### Model IV:

Based as well on  Modelo II, however, we consider index $j=(l,k)$ where $l$ accounts for the $l$-th state  and $k$ for the type of health service, $j \in \{1,...,165\}$.

Models are described graphiclly in Figure \ref{fig1}.

# Results

We show results for model four which performed better, both in convergence and goodness of fit creiteria (¬øPODRIAMOS AGREGAR QUIZ√Å LA MAXIMA ESTAD√çSTICA DE CONVERGENCIA O EL PROMEDIO PARA LOS PARAMETROS DEL MODELO O DE TODOS LOS MODELOS?) . We show the posterior distributions for parameteres of interest at different levels of the model. It is worth pointing out that we are displaying the log hazard ratio, hence positive values for parameters will point to increasing risks for the corresponing transition and level.   

Increased risk for hospitalization was observed at the global population level for chronic renal desease, whereas for death such was the case for COPD and the interaction of diabetes:hypertension:obesity.


# Disscusion
Through time it has been proved that the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, inmmuno-suppression and chronic kidney disease are associated to a worse outcome for the patient diagnosed with COVID-19, specially those who are hospitalized and ICU due intubation; but to our knowledge this is the first study which analyzed the time elapsed between the patient first symptoms, hospitalization and death; all this analysis can break down to the different states of the republic and the healthcare institution in them. Because of this it is possible to distinguish those for which the risk of hospitalization and death increases.

One of the main problems is the precarious situation of the public healthcare system, universal coverage is estimated to be about 87% of the mexican population. It¬¥s clear that mexican healthcare has overrun during this pandemic and has appeal to private health providers to cope with the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Mexican population is the third place in obesity among the OCDE countries, combined with hypertension and/or diabetes could help  explain why the severe cases due to COVID-19 are so high. 

This study has shown that there are  differences in mortality between the different states of the republic; there are states in which the overall rate of mortality is higher possibly due the late hospitalization of patients such as Campeche, Jalisco, Morelos, Oaxaca, Puebla, Tabasco and Veracruz. Breaking down this analysis to level state we can deduce a higher risk of hospitalization, specifically in Veracruz HR which historically has been unsteady regarding the public healthcare system in sectors like IMSS, ISSSTE, SEDENA/SEMAR/PEMEX.


This analysis can be helpful to a regional level to improve healthcare assistance, additionally it could be useful to inform statistical estimation of parameters for an epidemiological model ADD REFERENCE.
