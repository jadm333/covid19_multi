# Introduction

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 by the World Health Organization.
The Mexican Health Authorithies declared the first lockdown on March 26 with 585 cases and 8 deaths reported for COVID-19 (2); at the end of 
the lockdown (june 5th 2020) the total cases were 110,026 and 13 170 deaths. Until November 1, Mexico is the fourth country in death rates of
SARS-CoV-19 (106,765 deaths), with 1,122,362 incident cases (3).

Over time it has become clear that the presence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and smoking are factors that increase 
the serious illness that leads to hospitalization and in 25% of the cases they required admission and intubation to the intensive care unit (4).
Mexico ranks second in obesity among OECD countries, with almost 72.5% obesity among the adult population, which is associated with the high 
prevalence of type 2 diabetes, estimated at 13% of the adult population in 2017, which is the highest rate among OECD countries (5); hypertension
is also one of the hights chronic diseases among adult population 30% (6). The high prevalence of this comorbidities besides the lack of a 
functional health care system is believed to be the main reason why the deaths rates in the country are so high.

Data used in the modeling comes from the official database by the Mexican Ministry of Health; the analysis provides of general overview of 
hospitalizations in each state of the country and the different health institutions within.

#Methods and materials

We considered four different Bayesian models  for trajectories of interest:  Symptoms-Hospitalization, Hospitalization-Death, in which non-informative initial distributions were used, located near $0$, to improve convergence. Additionally a $QR$ reparameterization for the covariable matrix was used, that is, if  $X$ is an  $N \times K$ covariable matrix, $X=QR$, where $Q$ is an ortogonal  matrix and  $R$ is an upper triangular matriz. In practice,  considering $X=Q'R'$ where $Q'=Q*\sqrt{n-1}$ and $R'=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n-1}}*R$ is convinient. Hence if  $\zeta$ is the  $N$ linear predictor  vector such that $\zeta=X\beta$, with $\beta$ a $K$  coefficient vector, then  $\zeta=X\beta=QR\beta=Q'R'\beta$. We used  $\zeta=Q'R'\beta$  for numerical stability. 


Modelo I: One level

For patient  $i$, with $M$ covariables, we assumed deaths and hospitalizations, $M_i$ y $H_i$ respectively,  are independent and follow  distributions: 
       $$ M_i \sim Weibull(\alpha, exp\{-(\frac{(Q^m\theta^m)+\mu^m}{\alpha})\}) \:\:\:\:\:\: y \:\:\: \:\:\:  H_i \sim Weibull(\alpha, exp\{-(\frac{(Q^h\theta^h)+\mu^h}{\alpha})\})$$


where  

  -$\alpha=\tau_\alpha \beta$ for $\tau_\alpha$ a given positive value and $\beta\sim Normal(0,1)$.
  
  -$\theta^m$ and $\theta^h$ are $M$-dimensional vectors.
  $Q^m$ and $Q^h$ are matrices of standarized covariables for deaths and hospitalizations respectively.

 -Hyperparameters $\mu ^{m}$ and $\mu ^{h}$, for deaths and hospitalizations correspondingly, with a given $\tau_{\mu}$ follow a normal distribution
    
  $$mu^m, \mu ^h \sim Normal (0, \tau_{\mu})$$
       

Model II: two levels
Using the first model an additional level is added to account for each state of Mexico to model deaths. The hospitalization  $H_i$  remains  unchanged and for each state  $j= 1,\ldots, 32$ and  patient $i$,  $M_{i,j}$ has distribution:

  $$M_{i,j} \sim Weibull(\alpha, exp\{- \frac{(Q^m\theta^m)+\mu^m+\mu^{L_1}}{\alpha} \})$$
Where  $\mu^{L_1}=\nu^{L_1}*\frac{\sigma^{L_1}}{\tau^{L_1}}$, have the following distributions

   $$\nu^{L1} \sim Normal(0,1)$$
   $$\sigma^{L1} \sim Normal(0,1)$$
  $$\tau^{L1} \sim Gamma(a,a)$$ with  $a0$ a given positive value.

Model III: Three levels
Based on  Model II, we consider a third level to include the type of health service where patients are hospitalized, $k$ for patient
 $i$ in state  $j$ we have $M_{i,j,k}$ distributed as

  $$M_{i,j,k} \sim Weibull(\alpha, exp\{- \frac{(Q^m\theta^m)+\mu^m+\mu^{L_1}+\mu^{L_2}}{\alpha} \})$$
Where $\mu^{L_2}=\nu^{L_2}*\frac{\sigma^{L_2}}{\tau^{L_2}}$, with distributions: 
     
  $$\nu^{L_2} \sim Normal(0,1)$$
  $$\sigma^{L_2} \sim Normal(0,1)$$
  $$\tau^{L_2} \sim Gamma(a,a)$$ with $a$ a given positive value.
  
Model IV:
Based as well in  Modelo II, however, we consider index� $l=(j,k)$ where $j$ accounts for the $j-$-th state  and $k$ for the type of health service, $j \in \{1,...,153\}$ where the distribution for deaths is given by

   $$M_{i,l} \sim Weibull(\alpha, exp\{- \frac{(Q^m\theta^m)+\mu^m+\mu^{L_1}}{\alpha} \})$$
